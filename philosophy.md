* I Don't Live with [Broken Windows](http://blog.codinghorror.com/the-broken-window-theory/)
* I practice continuous improvement using [Kaizen](http://www.kaizen.com/about-us/definition-of-kaizen.html)
* I Measure with objective metrics
  * If you can't measure it, you can't improve it. - Peter Drucker
  * I use [OKR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OKR) to create objective metrics

* I am always determined to find out not only a solution but also the fundamental reasons why that solution worked.
* I am a perfectionist. But I am aware of business needs. I Know when to stop.

* I am highly disciplined
  * I work hard to shape my habits
  * I make a conscious effort to improve my skills
