* Mentoring & Coaching 

## Software development

I work with Ruby on Rails since 2006 and Javascript since 2001.
I worked on multiple projects for different [clients](/happy_clients/) most of them closed source.
I am trying to change that and I'm starting to do more Open source code.
You can check my [github projects](/github/). 
I also worked with php, node.js and .NET. But my heart is in Ruby.

I also have experience as a Sysadmin.
I learned linux back in 2001 and moved out of Windows XP.
This are some of the things I've done:

* scripts in bash
* solved math problems with bash
* Monit
* created init scripts using runit and init.d

## Process & Metrics

I certified as a Scrum Master in 2011 and I implemented Scrum on teams of 5 or 6 developers.
Then, I focused on Building processes and goals as CTO at [Tangosource](http://tangosource.com).

I trained more than 50 developers from trainees to senior developers.
Some of the them are working in San Francisco, other are working in Guadalajara and some are doing freelance work.
